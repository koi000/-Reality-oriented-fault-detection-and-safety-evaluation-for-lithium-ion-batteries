## we have released a dataset comprising operational data from five accident-related EVs of various models. This dataset encompasses detailed battery pack operation data, including information from individual cells and temperature probes, recorded by the battery management system.

    The code for data visualization and the code for our proposed fault detection and security risk assessment algorithms have been uploaded
