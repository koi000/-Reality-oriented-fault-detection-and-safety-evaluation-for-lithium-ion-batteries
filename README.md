## we have released a dataset comprising operational data from five accident-related EVs of various models. This dataset encompasses detailed battery pack operation data, including information from individual cells and temperature probes, recorded by the battery management system.
##The code for data visualization and the code for our proposed fault detection and security risk assessment algorithms have been uploaded

## If you use this data set to do other researches, you need to cite this paper.
